This is a profound and often startling experience. In psychology, this is sometimes related to depersonalization or dissociation, but in philosophy, it touches on Cartesian Dualism (the idea that the mind and body are distinct substances).
Here are several ways to describe that sensation, ranging from creative and metaphorical to clinical and analytical, depending on the context you need.
1. The "Pilot in a Vessel" Approach
This focuses on the mechanical separation—the feeling that "you" are a tiny operator inside a biological machine.
 * "I looked into the mirror and realized I wasn't the face staring back. I was merely the pilot, sitting somewhere behind the eyes, looking out through the windows of a biological machine."
 * "My reflection felt like a vessel I was currently inhabiting. The skin, the eyes, the mouth—they were just the hardware my consciousness was using to interact with the world."
 * "I felt like a ghost in a machine. The connection snapped, and suddenly I was just a passenger in a body that breathed and blinked on its own."
2. The "Stranger" Approach
This focuses on the sudden lack of recognition or the "uncanny valley" feeling of seeing yourself as an object.
 * "A wave of estrangement washed over me. The face in the glass was familiar, yet utterly alien—like a word you repeat until it loses its meaning."
 * "I experienced a sudden jamais vu. I knew intellectually that the reflection was me, but emotionally, I was looking at a stranger. There was 'The Body' standing there, and 'The Mind' floating somewhere else, observing it."
 * "It was as if I was looking at a portrait of someone I used to know. The link between my internal 'I' and that external form was severed."
3. The "Anatomical/Biological" Approach
This describes the realization of the body as mere matter (flesh and bone) distinct from the abstract mind.
 * "I stopped seeing 'myself' and started seeing biology. I saw the mechanics of the iris, the texture of the skin, the structure of the bone. I felt trapped inside a cage of calcium and chemistry."
 * "My consciousness felt untethered. I realized my thoughts had no physical weight, yet they were chained to this heavy, physical anchor reflected in the glass."
 * "For the first time, I felt the distinct weight of my own existence separate from my form. My mind was infinite and fluid, while the reflection was static and finite."
4. Key Vocabulary to Use
If you are writing this for a story or an essay, these specific words can help anchor the description:
 * Dissociation: A disconnection between thoughts, surroundings, and identity.
 * Dualism: The division of something conceptually into two opposed or contrasted aspects (mind vs. matter).
 * Corporeal: Relating to a person's body, especially as opposed to their spirit.
 * Tethered/Untethered: The feeling of being tied to (or released from) the physical form.
 * Visceral: Deep, internal feelings; relating to the physical body.
Example of a Full Description
> "I leaned over the sink, locking eyes with my reflection, and suddenly the room went quiet. The invisible thread that usually binds my identity to my face snapped. I wasn't the person in the mirror anymore; I was the observer behind the eyes.
> It was a terrifying clarity. I felt my mind distinct from my body—two separate objects occupying the same space by chance. That face was just a shell, a heavy biological suit that I was wearing, while the real 'me' floated silently inside, watching the reflection blink."
